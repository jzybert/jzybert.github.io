                <p>
                    Slate is a website for Amazon Prime Video studio partners (Disney, MGM, HBO, etc.) to upload and manage their movie and TV content 
                    ultimately to be shown on Prime Video. This product replaced a legacy system developed in 2015 to give a fresh and modern look as well as 
                    speed up the process of creating a new asset on Prime Video.

                    I worked on this project as a co-lead front-end engineer from August 2023 to April 2024 after which it was handed off to core support teams.

                        <p>
                            As a <b>Front-end Software Engineer II</b> in Amazon Prime Video, I was responsible for leading the daily development of the 
                            Slate application. I worked with many other engineers, front-end and back-end, as well a UX designer to collaborate and move a quick pace 
                            in order to deliver the new tool within six months. My primary features included title (movie/series) creation and file upload.

                        <p>
                            The team for this project was comprised of two front-end engineers and four back-end engineers. Myself and the other 
                            front-end engineer met daily to prioritze work and strategize about implementing the product. We partnered with our back-end 
                            engineers to call REST APIs for persisting the TV/movie content. We also met weekly with a UX Designer for input on the 
                            product vision.
