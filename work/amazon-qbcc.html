                <p>
                    The <b>Quarterback Command Center (QBCC)</b> is an application for Amazon Robotics Operations managers (dubbed "Quarterbacks" internally) 
                    to view real-time warehouse station, package, and robotic drive unit state and simplifies the management process by prioritizing 
                    problems for them. The tool was conceptualized out of a need to standardize problem prioritization across Amazon's vast warehouse network.

                    I worked on this project from 2022 through 2023 as the lead front-end engineer and after a brief break at Amazon Prime Video,
                    I continued back on the project as a on back-end software engineer in 2024.

                        <p>
                            I've had two roles for the QBCC project. The first was as a <b>Front-end Software Engineer II</b>. It was my responsibility
                            to set up the website architecture using Amazon Web Services, design the user interface and collaborate directly with support teams
                            and operations to create that vision, and construct the API middleware for retrieving robotic state data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Back as a <b>Software Development Engineer II</b>, I've been responsible for programming back-end microservices to pull in, 
                            process, and store real-time robotic state must quicker than we were able to before.

                        <p>
                            The team for this project was comprised of four engineers. We worked directly with three other support team members 
                            who gathered customer feedback and made site visits to show off our tool. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, we worked with countless operations team members directly to guide the product.
